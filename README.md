## üê≥ Docker and CI/CD

### Docker

To containerize the application, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t student-performance-predictor .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 student-performance-predictor
   ```

3. **Access the application:**

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project employs GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow includes:

- **Linting and Testing:** Ensures code quality through automated linting and testing.
- **Build and Deploy:** Builds the Docker image and deploys the app to a cloud platform.

Check out the workflow file in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.
